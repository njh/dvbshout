dvbshout
========
Nicholas J. Humfrey <njh@aelius.com>


dvbshout takes an MPEG transport stream from a DVB card, 
extracts audio channels from stream, and sends the audio to
an Icecast/Shoutcast server.

For the latest version of dvbshout, please see:
http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~njh/dvbshout/

It is released under the GPL licence, see COPYING for details.



Configuration
=============

dvbshout is configured using a single configuration file. 
A script called 'scan2dvbshout.pl' is provided to convert 
a channels.conf file (as created by the 'scan' DVB utility) to a 
skeleton dvbshout.conf. An example configuration file is also included.

The [server] section of the configuration file contains the Icecast/Shoutcast 
server settings. The [tuning] section contains the settings for tuning in the
DVB device. There are then multiple [channel] sections for each of the channels 
you wish to send to the server. 

The 'dvbshout' binary takes a single parameter, the location of its 
configuration file.



TODO
====

More error checking of incoming streams. 
Add RTP support.
Quiet/verbose command line switches.
